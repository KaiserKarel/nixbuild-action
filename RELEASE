v10

## Changes

* Add a reusable [CI Workflow](https://github.com/nixbuild/nixbuild-action/tree/v10#using-the-ci-workflow).

  This workflow automatically evaluates your Nix Flake and build checks and/or packages. Each build runs as a separate job in GitHub Actions and therefore provides you with a simple CI [dashboard](https://github.com/nixbuild/nixbuild-action/actions/workflows/ci-example.yml) in the GitHub Actions UI.

  The reusable workflow takes care of setting up Nix and nixbuild.net inside your workflow, making the required configuration truly minimal:

  ```
  name: Examples
  on: push
  jobs:
    my-nix-builds:
      uses: nixbuild/nixbuild-action/.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml@v10
      secrets:
        nixbuild_ssh_key: ${{ secrets.nixbuild_ssh_key }}
  ```
