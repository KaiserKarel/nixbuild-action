v16

## Changes

* Support authenticating against nixbuild.net using [auth tokens](https://github.com/nixbuild/nixbuild-action/tree/v16#token-authentication) instead of SSH keys. The auth tokens are based on [Biscuit](https://www.biscuitsec.org/) and will in the future enable users to define authorization policies. Currently, they can only be used for authentication.

* ci-workflow: Update nix-quick-install-action to v22, which means the default Nix version used is bumped to 2.14.1.

* Document [remote store building](https://github.com/nixbuild/nixbuild-action/tree/v16#remote-store-building).

* Update inputs to match changes in nixbuild.net settings.
